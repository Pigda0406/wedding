### Packages 

[responsive_builder :](https://pub.dev/packages/responsive_builder) The responsive builder package contains widgets that allows you to create a readable responsive UI. The package is inspired by the Responsive UI Flutter series created by FilledStacks.

[flutter_bloc :](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)  Widgets that make it easy to integrate blocs and cubits into [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). Built to work with [package:bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc). The Bloc library provides very good ðŸ¦„ tooling and compared to other state management solutions that use Streams, it's a pure gem.

[get_it :](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) This is a simple **Service Locator** for Dart and Flutter projects with some additional goodies highly inspired by [Splat](https://github.com/reactiveui/splat). It can be used instead of `InheritedWidget` or `Provider` to access objects e.g. from your UI.

[equatable:](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable) Being able to compare objects in `Dart` often involves having to override the `==` operator as well as `hashCode`.

[firebase :](https://firebase.google.com/) is the most amazing back-end as a service (BaaS) developed by Google for mobile and web application development that helps you build, improve, grow your app and deliver richer app experiences.
